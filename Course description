Title: Adversarial attacks in deep reinforcement learning 

:::: Description :::: 

The course is structured around independent study and research, focusing on understanding adversarial attacks in (deep) reinforcement learning systems. 

The course will take outset in the following curriculum/papers, but may deviate as the course progresses: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9536399, https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08452,  

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08025.pdf, https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3547330. 

 

:::: Learning objectives ::::: 

Understand and explain various security vulnerabilities and adversarial attacks in (deep) reinforcement learning settings. 

Scope and define a relevant study of adversarial attacks in DRL, particularly identifying a relevant set of adversarial attacks and specific algorithms to be studied. 

Identify or create a suitable simulation environment for examining a relevant set of adversarial attacks. 

Understand, implement, and evaluate a suitable set of algorithms for studying adversarial attacks (in a simulation environment). 

Concisely document and analyze the results using appropriate methods.  

Create, maintain, and present code professionally with version control practices.
